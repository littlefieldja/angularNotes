NG-CONF DAY 1.... 

NOTES
angular ivy ... newest version 
angular 2020 survery
angular io podcast 

whats new in v9
- backwards compatable 
- smaller bundle sizes 
  - tree shaking (only uses reference you are using) 
  - less generated code 
  - most results is a 30% smaller application
- faster application 
  - separate dep compliation -> only compiles code not dependiences.
  - No JSON conversion 
  - most build times are 40% less time.
  - ng serve is doing the same checks as ng build 
- simpler ways to code 
  - debugging is using stack track... links take you to the line 
  - debugging demo using developer tools sources tabs to see source code ********
  - new methods on ng global... learn how to use this 
  - building errors are better
- typescripit update to 3.7 and 3.8 

CLI builders -> Mike Hartington twitter @mhartington 
ex. ng build
  - really running broswer builder
ex. ng serve 
  - really running dev server builder 
ex. ng test 
  - karma builder
  
Session 2  
Jeremy Elbourn -> WAI-ARIA @jelbourn 
  - using roles in html elements
  - parameterized sass mixins
  - main point is that features with in html dont know about each other. mat tables, mat patigiation, mat headers dont know 
  about each other each one is its own thing 
  - decompose and be deliberate with re-composition   
  - Customization is inevitable, build for flexibily, everything you do has trade offs 

Wagner Maciel
  - Angular Universal 
    - tool kit for server side and prerendering for angular 
  why do server side rendering 
  1) show page one faster
  2) improve performance for weaker devices
  3) SEO and web crawlers looking for what your page is about in search engins 
  
  steps in demo 
  new project 
  ng add @nguniversal/express-engine 
  ng build for server side code is wayyyy faster 
  
  new features 
  - live code reload ... works more like ng serve reload and rel compile on save 
  - prerendering gernerate and save static pages to the file system 
    - you can server this so that out side your project 
    
  DEMO of new features 
  npm run serve: ssr

Deborah Kurata  need to rewatch this lecture later **************
 - map, switchMap, concertMap, 
 
SESSION 3
stephen Fluin 
- source map explorer

five topics 
- micro frontends
	
- server side rendering 

- monorepo and code sharing 
 - github 
 - bazel 
 - pullapprove 
 - VIRAL MONOREPORSITORY 
 	one app, one library 
	two apps, one library -> shared libs ... everything is using one libaray 

- varied enviorments 
	- using pull demand rather then forcing stuff down the line 
	- increase value in collaboration 
	- Constructable stylesheets 

Business Justification 
	- One version 
	- Security 
	- Performance 
	- Recommended path 
	- Everyone else is doing it 
	- Component Usage Tracking 
		- as a libs building your can track how many people use your libs 
		
John Papa @john_papa

	- lazy loading 
		- rather then waiting for everything up front ... load things as people click them 
		- preloading is a middle between both 

	- preload none, preload all, .... custome preloading 
	setting is located in app.module.ts
	
	three different options for preloading js bundles 
	1) opt in or opt out each bundle
	2) check network speed ... 
	3) predict based on user behaviors 
		ex. some one looking for something typical searches something then look at the details ... you can code it 
		
	take aways 
	define a preload strategy 
	use angular essentails for snippets 
	
	
	DAY 2 
	
	Demo domain driven design 
	
	
	domain driven design by Eric Evans 
	
	strategic 
	-> decomposing a System 
	tactical
	-> design patterns and practices
	
	Example application 
	user cases 
		need a catalog with all IT things 
		need to have a way to get approvals 
		ordering the stuff 
		specs 
		
		Employee -> request product 
		IT -> specify Order 
		Manager -> approval 
		Buying Agent -> send order 
		
		Manager -> Request budget 
		Manager -> approve budget 
		
		Product is the main role 
		budeget is a role but not main. 
		
		context mapping all domains need spectification -> catalog <- approval
		maybe all domains call a shared kernel 
		maybe you can use API's from the catalog to talk to everyone
		
		BOOK FOR NG angulararchitects.io/book DDD, Nx MonoReops by manfred steyer 

Vishal Kumar
	THINGS to to consider while writting large scaled applications 
	Seperation of considers 
		PROS 
			- issues are contained 
			- easy owernership of applications 
			
	Micro Frontend Architecture 
		- Isolated Mini apps 
		- Custom elements 
		- lib components 
	
	Effective Content Management 
	- headless CMS 
	PROS
		- customer owns images 
		- no deployment needed 
		- devs controls presentation layer 
		- build muilt UIs with same content 
		- performance 
	
	Error Tracking 
	prevention strategies 
	
	make toggels to turn features on and off 
	
Wesley Faulkner 
Networking how to network 

	Big take away 
	- wait for someone to finish ... dont key on just the thing you want too. 
	- dont think about your response during their turn 
	- phone takes still smile while talking your voice is happier
	
	
SESSION 5

James Daniel 
TOPIC firebase 
	angular fire v6.0 
	
Brandon Roberts 
Routers with Ivy 

Young gun with AI 
 - tensel.js 
 - ML in angular is pretty good 
 
SESSION 6

Jorge Cano 
- BAZEL 


Debugging with Anthony Humes
- broswer debugging methods on inspecting elments 
- 0$ gets the last event 



DAY 3 

- Keynote **** rewatch the start 

	- learn how to perf anazlys your application 
		- install source map explorer 
		- turn on source maps in production build 
		- run prod build 
		- run source map explorer on built code 
	perf tools 
	- source map explorer
	- lighthouse 
	- webpage test 
	
	- dont use a lot of 3rd party libraries 
	- try to use things in ES bundles 
	
	- another thing to use is lazy loading 
	
	- stay upto date... keep your code running in the newest version 
	
Keynote 2 Minko Gechev 
	- unvirsal application are something to understan more better 
	- prerendering is also something to look at 
	- JAM stack 
	- Scully by hero devs 

Session 7

	- Jennifer Wadella 
		- forms containers 
	
	- Sam Julien NgRx is the topc
		- ngrx effects? 
		- the role off efects in ngrx auth 
		- effects are the dj of ngrx 
		- in ngrx compnents -> effects ->  reducers 
		- effects -> talk to services and communicate with API 
		- effects also -> handle control flow logic 
			they are a task runner 
		
		- three main issues 
			- actions that only trigger effects 
			- non dispatching effects 
			- complex effects 
			
		- when doing auth everything above happens 
		
		login process 
		start login -> login providor -> back to client with true or false 
		typically in vinallia you have auth service 
		
	- Dan Wahlin - observable services to observable store 
		- one service that lots of services can call 
		- observable store ... a service that stores data and can be called from lots of other services 
		- pretty go place to start with store state .... something to consider ... 
		
SESSION 8 
	david east angluar and firebase 
	- super fast really smart
	
	to talks about what is coming up in ngrx ... take a pluralsight while it is free 
	

SESSION 9 
	
	- Shai
	testangular.io to learn more about testing angular 
	extrnal intergration test 
	
	three different test 
	scope    -> 
	boundaries ->
	subject  -> hirez.link/ng-conf-2020 
	
	
	- KEEN 
	- install angular language services
