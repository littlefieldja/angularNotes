NG-CONF DAY 1.... 

NOTES
angular ivy ... newest version 
angular 2020 survery
angular io podcast 

whats new in v9
- backwards compatable 
- smaller bundle sizes 
  - tree shaking (only uses reference you are using) 
  - less generated code 
  - most results is a 30% smaller application
- faster application 
  - separate dep compliation -> only compiles code not dependiences.
  - No JSON conversion 
  - most build times are 40% less time.
  - ng serve is doing the same checks as ng build 
- simpler ways to code 
  - debugging is using stack track... links take you to the line 
  - debugging demo using developer tools sources tabs to see source code ********
  - new methods on ng global... learn how to use this 
  - building errors are better
- typescripit update to 3.7 and 3.8 

CLI builders -> Mike Hartington twitter @mhartington 
ex. ng build
  - really running broswer builder
ex. ng serve 
  - really running dev server builder 
ex. ng test 
  - karma builder
  
Session 2  
Jeremy Elbourn -> WAI-ARIA @jelbourn 
  - using roles in html elements
  - parameterized sass mixins
  - main point is that features with in html dont know about each other. mat tables, mat patigiation, mat headers dont know 
  about each other each one is its own thing 
  - decompose and be deliberate with re-composition   
  - Customization is inevitable, build for flexibily, everything you do has trade offs 

Wagner Maciel
  - Angular Universal 
    - tool kit for server side and prerendering for angular 
  why do server side rendering 
  1) show page one faster
  2) improve performance for weaker devices
  3) SEO and web crawlers looking for what your page is about in search engins 
  
  steps in demo 
  new project 
  ng add @nguniversal/express-engine 
  ng build for server side code is wayyyy faster 
  
  new features 
  - live code reload ... works more like ng serve reload and rel compile on save 
  - prerendering gernerate and save static pages to the file system 
    - you can server this so that out side your project 
    
  DEMO of new features 
  npm run serve: ssr

Deborah Kurata  need to rewatch this lecture later **************
 - map, switchMap, concertMap, 
 
SESSION 3
stephen Fluin 
- source map explorer

five topics 
- micro frontends
	
- server side rendering 

- monorepo and code sharing 
 - github 
 - bazel 
 - pullapprove 
 - VIRAL MONOREPORSITORY 
 	one app, one library 
	two apps, one library -> shared libs ... everything is using one libaray 

- varied enviorments 
	- using pull demand rather then forcing stuff down the line 
	- increase value in collaboration 
	- Constructable stylesheets 

Business Justification 
	- One version 
	- Security 
	- Performance 
	- Recommended path 
	- Everyone else is doing it 
	- Component Usage Tracking 
		- as a libs building your can track how many people use your libs 
		
John Papa @john_papa

	- lazy loading 
		- rather then waiting for everything up front ... load things as people click them 
		- preloading is a middle between both 

	- preload none, preload all, .... custome preloading 
	setting is located in app.module.ts
	
	three different options for preloading js bundles 
	1) opt in or opt out each bundle
	2) check network speed ... 
	3) predict based on user behaviors 
		ex. some one looking for something typical searches something then look at the details ... you can code it 
		
	take aways 
	define a preload strategy 
	use angular essentails for snippets 
	
	
	DAY 2 
	
	Demo domain driven design 
	
	
	domain driven design by Eric Evans 
	
	strategic 
	-> decomposing a System 
	tactical
	-> design patterns and practices
	
	Example application 
	user cases 
		need a catalog with all IT things 
		need to have a way to get approvals 
		ordering the stuff 
		specs 
		
		Employee -> request product 
		IT -> specify Order 
		Manager -> approval 
		Buying Agent -> send order 
		
		Manager -> Request budget 
		Manager -> approve budget 
		
		Product is the main role 
		budeget is a role but not main. 
		
		context mapping all domains need spectification -> catalog <- approval
		maybe all domains call a shared kernel 
		maybe you can use API's from the catalog to talk to everyone

Vishal Kumar
	THINGS to to consider while writting large scaled applications 
	Seperation of considers 
		PROS 
			- issues are contained 
			- easy owernership of applications 
			
	Micro Frontend Architecture 
		- Isolated Mini apps 
		- Custom elements 
		- lib components 
	
	Effective Content Management 
	- headless CMS 
	PROS
		- customer owns images 
		- no deployment needed 
		- devs controls presentation layer 
		- build muilt UIs with same content 
		- performance 
	
	Error Tracking 
	prevention strategies 
	
	make toggels to turn features on and off
